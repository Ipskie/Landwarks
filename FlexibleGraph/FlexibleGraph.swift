/**
 Against my better judgement, this entire view is written in ONE struct, so that they may all share `Namespace`s.
 Alternative 1: pass `Namespace.ID` down 10 levels of hierarchy (hint: not happening)
 Alternative 2: make `Namespace.ID` an environment var (skip the hierarchy). I tried this, and swift started complaining at me, so here we are.

    /** Observational Notes, 20.12.02
        Issue 1: Appending Pages when the user scrolls up causes a ~60ms animation hitch. I haven't been able to solve that.
        Issue 2: Including a very large (but finite) number of rows causes the app to consume a LOT of memory (20000rows = 200mb)
        Compromise: We will include *some* rows, AND allow the list to grow beyond that number.
        Most users will not experience the animation hitching (lordwilling), but those wishing to dip years into their Toggl archive will be *able* to do so.
            
     Note: there is a soft limit on past days, but a HARD limit on future days

     Note: UIKit scrollsToTop (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscrollview/1619421-scrollstotop)
     is not (yet) available in ScrollView, so tapping the status bar sends the view ALLLL the way down.
     Therefore I am capping future exploration at 0 days, which should not affect TimeEntries that aren't recorded in the future.
     If this changes, do allow exploration of the future by increasing the cap
